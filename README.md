This package defines some tools to interact with the SLURM job handler on high performance computer clusters via both a python API and command-line interface.

Some of these tools will be just (more readable) synonyms of conventional SLURM tools, others are useful derivatives that make working with SLURM quicker or easier.

Of course, the native SLURM CLI is more powerful and, naturally, not all functionalities will be available through `slurmtools`, however, the purpose of `slurmtools` is merely to provide an easier to handle SLURM interface for vanilla users.
